An multi-page app skeleton in React, main structures comes from [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md).

## Features

* Tweak the webpack config(s) with using "react-app-rewired".
* Backward compatibility for browsers with using "core-js".
* Make developing React multi-page applications easier.
* Convenient to achieve different pages by writing different react container components.
* Convenient to implement page interfaces with using "antd".
* Convenient to implement data requests between the front and back ends with using "axios".

  * `yarn start` -> Runs the app in development mode (on port 3000).
  * `yarn build` -> Builds the app for production to the build folder.
  * `yarn test` -> Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.
